    "## Airport Capacity Simulation Exercise\n",

    "\n",
    "These are the assumptions i will be making in this simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Passengers arrive according to a Poisson distribution with Î»1 = 50 per minute (i.e., mean interarrival rate $\\lambda_1$ = 0.02 minutes) to the ID/boarding-pass check queue, where there are several servers who each have exponential service time with mean rate $\\lambda_2$ = 0.75 minutes. [Hint: model them as one block that has more than one resource.] \n",
    "\n",
    "2. After that, the passengers are assigned to the shortest of the several personal-check queues, where they go through the personal scanner (time is uniformly distributed between 0.5 minutes and 1 minute).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I will build a simulation of the system, and then vary the number of ID/boarding-pass checkers and personal-check queues to determine how many are needed to keep average wait times below 15 minutes."
